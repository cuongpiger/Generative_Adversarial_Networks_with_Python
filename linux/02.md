# Error:
```bash=
E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)  
E: Unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock (/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend), is another process using it?
```

# Solution:
- For above wait for the process to complete. If this does not happen run in terminal:
  ```bash=
  sudo killall apt apt-get
  ```

- If none of the above works, remove the lock files. Run in terminal: (Note that this can seriously break your system.):
  ```bash=
  sudo rm /var/lib/apt/lists/lock && \
    sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock && \
    sudo rm /var/lib/dpkg/lock* && \
    sudo dpkg --configure -a && \
    sudo apt update
  ```
