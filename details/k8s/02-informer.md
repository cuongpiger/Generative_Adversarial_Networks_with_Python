# Informer

- In Kubernetes (k8s), an "**Informer**" is a **client library** used to **watch for changes to Kubernetes resources** and **receive notifications** about those changes. Informers are an essential component of Kubernetes controllers and other components that need to react to changes in the state of the cluster.

- Here's how informers work:
  1. **Watch API Endpoints**: Informers establish watch connections with Kubernetes API server endpoints for specific resources. These resources can include pods, services, deployments, custom resources defined by users, and more.

  2. **Caching**: Informers maintain an in-memory cache of the observed resources' state. This cache is periodically synchronized with the Kubernetes API server to ensure it reflects the most recent state of the cluster.

  3. **Event Notification**: When changes occur to watched resources (e.g., creation, update, deletion), the Kubernetes API server sends notifications to the informer client. These notifications contain information about the changes, including the affected resource's name, namespace, and the nature of the change.

  4. **Callback Handlers**: Informer clients typically register callback handlers to be invoked when events are received. These handlers can perform various actions in response to the events, such as reconciling the observed state with the desired state, updating internal data structures, triggering workflows, or emitting metrics for monitoring.

  5. **Efficiency and Scalability**: Informers are designed to be efficient and scalable, allowing Kubernetes controllers and other components to efficiently monitor large numbers of resources and react to changes in real-time. Informers use optimizations like rate limiting, backoff strategies, and intelligent resync mechanisms to manage resource watching and event processing effectively.

  6. **Client Libraries**: Kubernetes provides client libraries in various programming languages (e.g., Go, Python, Java) that encapsulate the logic for working with informers and interacting with the Kubernetes API server. These client libraries abstract away many of the complexities of managing informers, making it easier for developers to build controllers and custom controllers.

- Overall, informers play a crucial role in Kubernetes controllers, custom controllers, operators, and other components that need to react to changes in the state of Kubernetes resources. They enable Kubernetes applications to monitor, respond to, and reconcile the state of the cluster dynamically, ensuring that the cluster remains in the desired state.
